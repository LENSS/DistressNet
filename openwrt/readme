1. Overview
It seems that these are basically source/makefiles for different versions of ibrdtn software, as a package in the openwrt system. ``buildroot.sh'' exports a openwrt system source code. The ``ibrcommon'', ``ibrdtnd'', ... under each version of ibrdtn, seem to be packages of the openwrt system. 

2. Details
1) different version of ibrdtn software:
ibrdtn-064
ibrdtn-065
old
package-ibrdtn-0.6.1

2) compiled rom for openwrt system with these packages (not sure):
openwrt.netboot.mikrotik

3) Unknown folder/files:
keys
100_fix.patch
all.config
notes (some notes for compiling openwrt?)

3. Note for cross-compiling openwrt/ibrdtn/boost/asio(distressnet code)
	1) compile the entire openwrt system to build the compiling environment
	2) compile from ibr-dtn-0.8.0, since ibr-dtn-0.6.5 gives errors (haven't test with distressnet code)
	3) compile boost_1.38.0 library
		i) Download Makefile for boost-jam
		ii) Download Makefile/pathces for python-2.6
		iii) compile python-2.6 first
		iv) Download Makefile/patches for boost_1.38.0
		v) edit Makefile, disable zlib, bzip2 (haven't test with distressnet code, if not working, specify zlib.h, bzlib.h path)
		vi) compile, install

1. You don't really need to compile the entire OpenWRT system if only need
to run fogbox, btags, etc. as there are pre-compiled roms on internet. But 
if you need to modify source files in asio/ folder, you will at least need
the cross-compile toolchain. Then either compile the toolchain (not recomm-
-end, as you might run into other problems) or compile the entire system 
(recommended). If you need to compile the system, make sure that the ipv6
module is selected to be compiled. Otherwise, in your working system, opkg 
might not be able to install the correct kmod-ipv6 when 
``opkg install kmod-ipv6''

2. All compiled libraries for boost and ibrdtn-0.8.0 are in 
		openwrt_libs_boost_ibrdtn.tar
Basically if there's a working Mikrotik router with Openwrt backfire system,
copy those libraries to /usr/lib folder, then the binaries for fogbox, btag
router-end in asio/ tar file should work.

3. If need to compile boost_1.38.0 and ibrdtn-0.8.0, put everything in
backfire_libs/ to the packages/ folder in your openwrt source code directory. 
These packages and their Makefile should work when you do 
	make packages/boost/compile
or  make packages/ibr(something) compile. Origin packages don't work as you 
need to patch many files and some Makefile needs change.

	Compile the entire system, or at least the toolchain for openwrt before
make packages/package/compile

4. A copy of compiled openwrt image is put in compiled_openwrt_image.tar.
